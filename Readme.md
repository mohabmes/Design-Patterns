## Creational Pattern
Design patterns that involve instantiating concrete objects.

- **Singleton Pattern**: A design pattern that enforces a single instantiation of a  class that is globally accessible

- **Factory Pattern**: A pattern that delegates concrete instantiation to a method of a subclass.

## Structural Pattern
Design patterns that describe how objects are connected to one another.

- **Facade pattern**: A design pattern that involves encapsulating a complex system in a simple interface.

- **Adpter Pattern**: A design pattern that connects two incompatible interfaces by fitting between them and providing a compatible interface to both.

- **Composite Pattern**: A design pattern for composing nested structures of objects and dealing with these objects uniformly.

- **Proxy Pattern**: A design pattern allows a proxy class to represent a real subject class

- **Decorator Pattern**: A structural pattern that allows additional behaviours or responsibilities to be dynamically attached to an object, through the use of aggregation to combine behaviours at run time.

### Behavioural Pattern
Design​ patterns that focus on ways that individual objects collaborate to achieve a common goal.

- **Template Method Pattern**: A design​ ​pattern defines an algorithm’s steps generally, deferring the implementation of some steps to subclasses.

- **Chain of Responsibility Pattern**: A design​ ​pattern​ ​that is a chain of objects(linked together) that are responsible for handling requests.

- **State Pattern**: A behavioural design pattern that can occur as objects in your code are aware of their current state, and thus can choose an appropriate behaviour based on their current state. When the current state changes, this behaviour can be altered.

- **Command Pattern**: A behavioural pattern for encapsulating requests as objects.

- **Observer Pattern**: A behavioral​ pattern​ for​ event handling.
